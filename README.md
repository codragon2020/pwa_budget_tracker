  ## Description
🔍 This budget tracking app was built to learn how PWA (Progressive Web Apps) work. The user should be able to add expenses and deposits to their budget with or without a connection to the internet. When entering transactions offline, they should populate the total. As the user comes back online the transaction will move from pending to added.
